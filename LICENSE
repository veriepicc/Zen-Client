Copyright (C) 2025 Zen Dvelopment

By reading this, you hereby agree to the following rules under pain of eternal cringe and immediate soul violation.

0. Definitions (LOL)

The Project: This absolutely chaotic Minecraft Bedrock hack client you’re staring at.

You: That absolute nerd who just opened this file.

Contributing: Actually doing something useful in the repo. Meme commits don’t count.

Unauthorized Shit: Literally anything else you try to do with this project. Don’t. Just don’t.

1. Permission (Kinda Not)

You may look at the code. That’s it.

You may touch the code only if you are directly pushing commits to the official repo. If you fork it and do literally anything else, your soul is forfeit.

2. Prohibited Shit

You may not sell this.

You may not redistribute it.

You may not claim it’s yours.


3. Offensive Humor Clause

You may not be offended by this license. If offended, you must apologize publicly on Twitter using only Bedrock edition emotes.

4. Soul-Commit Clause

Any usage outside of direct contribution to the official repo is considered sacrilegious.

Contributors must have at least 1 brain cell. If we detect less, automatic ban from the repo.

5. Warranty (LMAO, nope)

This software comes as-is, meaning it will probably crash, get you banned, or summon demons.

The author is not responsible for any angry mothers, broken keyboards, destroyed computers, or cursed Minecraft worlds.

6. Meme Clause

7. Enforcement

If you violate any rule here, you are legally obligated to:

Buy the author 5 energy drinks.

Record yourself apologizing in morse code.

Send a signed apology in the form of a JSON file with at least 1,000 characters.

8. Acceptance

Opening this repo constitutes instant and irreversible agreement. There is no opt-out. No take-backs. No mercy.
